To create icons for your Chrome extension, follow these steps:

1. Create three icon sizes in PNG format:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

2. Place all three icon files in this directory.

3. The icons should be square and visually consistent across all sizes.

4. For best results, use a simple, recognizable design that looks good at small sizes.

5. The icons should have a transparent background.

6. Save the files with the exact names specified above.

Note: These icons are required for the Chrome Web Store and will be used in different contexts within the browser.
